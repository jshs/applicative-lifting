---------

- The "applicative" command derives combinator reductions automatically, e.g.
  for I if C and K are provided. Therefore, the command no longer emits
  redundant proof obligations in such cases. This includes the derivation of
  C from BKW and interchange, as well as the derivation of the interchange law
  from C and I. Also added the S combinator, such that SK can be used instead
  of BCKW.

- Added support for arbitrary lifted relations via relators. An optional "set"
  operator can be provided, which may produce weaker subgoals (with additional
  premises) after application of a lifting proof method.

- Improved compatibility with locale interpretation; see Applicative_Sum for
  a use case.

- Small user-facing changes: more intuitive assignment of type variables,
  modified order of subgoals in the proof for "applicative"; changed some
  theorem names.
